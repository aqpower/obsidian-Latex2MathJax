# Latex2MathJax Plugin for Obsidian

When you copy math content from large language models (like ChatGPT), the formulas are typically provided in LaTeX format. However, Obsidian supports MathJax, and this plugin will **automatically convert the LaTeX formulas into MathJax format** when pasted into your notes.
